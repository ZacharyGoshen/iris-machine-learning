# Iris Flower Species Classification using Logistic Regression

The Iris flower data set is a multivariate data set introduced by British statistician Ronald Fisher in 1936. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three different species: Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Virginica. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and width of the petal and sepal lengths.

The goal of this project is to train a model that is capable of predicting an unknown sample's species with high accuracy using only the four features mentioned previously. However, before we create a model, we must understand the data we are working with. Running *vizualize_data.py* produces scatter plots for each pair of distinct features.
